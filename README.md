# pso2tricks.py
Helps GNU/Linux users install the PSO2 Tweaker to play the Japanese version.

## Requirements
This only requires the requests python library, everything else is part of python3's normal stack.
The shell script is highly optional, but it automates the requirements for people. It requires basic user permissions and will never need sudo.

## Usage
```
pso2tricks.py [-h]```
